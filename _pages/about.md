Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex, a passionate software developer interested in machine learning, cybersecurity, web development, and all things tech. I recently graduated from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/) with a First-Class Honours BSc in Computer Science. 

Over the past two years, alongside my studies, I have been working for [Revector](http://revector.com/), on the Raven Project, developing IMSI catchers and WiFi intelligence solutions for search and rescue and counterterrorism operations. Additionally, I have undertaken several freelance web development projects and interned multiple times within HMG, focusing on cybersecurity work. 

I have participated and won funding in several hackathon and startup competitions:

- 3rd Place - [Game Changer Startup Competition COP28](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aislinn-de-buitleir-139645214_this-weekend-was-the-game-changer-entrepreneurial-activity-7125081514555404288-wd99?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), 2024
- 1st Place - [Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7034659955408293888-yC9P?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), 2023
- Winner - [Durhack](https://durhack.com/) Domain.com challenge, 2022
- 3rd Place - [Durham University Bright Ideas Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/durham-university-venture-lab/), 2022

If you're interested in my work, would like to collaborate, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
